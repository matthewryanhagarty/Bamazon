# Bamazon

This is my submission for assignment ten: Bamazon. We were tasked with creating an CLI App that replicates an Amazon-like storefront using our recent understanding of MySQL. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory once a purchase is made. If the customer requests a quantity that is higher than what the store has in stock, they are notified that the transaction cannot happen and are prompted again using inquirer to make a purchase. In order to accomplish this, I had to utilize my understanding of JavaScript, SQL, MySQL Workbench, and Node.js as well as various node packages including mysql, cli-table and inquirer.
